        <h6>Swagath The Multi-Cuisine Restaurant</h6>
        <p>
            I absolutely like this restaurant as it serves my most favourite dish called Biryani.
            <b>Biryani is an emotion for me since my childhood.</b>
            Menu in this restaurant has wide variety of items starting from <b>starters to deserts and mocktails.</b>
            Apart from the taste and dishes provided by the restaurant i also like the services provided by the hotel staff
